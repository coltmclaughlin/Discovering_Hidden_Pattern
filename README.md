# Data Analysis - Discovering Hidden Patterns in Sequential and Numerical Data

This project aims to analyze data from an advanced online roulette simulator algorithm. With its seemingly simple sequential and numerical nature, this dataset presents substantial logical complexity, offering potential opportunities for discovering critical and subtle patterns.

## Objective
Our goal is to conduct an in-depth investigation to uncover essential patterns within the dataset. By identifying and understanding these patterns, we plan to develop strategies that can be effectively capitalized on, generating value and strategic insights.
We currently possess a proven profitable and long-term sustainable strategy. However, we believe there are other unexplored approaches and patterns, and we seek opportunities to expand and diversify our strategies, leveraging our potential for even greater success.

## Responsibilities
•	Analyze the dataset and apply different analytical methods to identify new patterns.

•	Provide insights and recommendations based on complex data findings.

•	Collaborate with the team to develop strategies that maximize the value extracted from the data.

## Database
The database, characterized by its simplicity, sequential, and numerical nature generated by an algorithm, has already revealed a distinct pattern. We will use this database to further explore and identify new patterns, assisting us in creating innovative strategies.

## Explanation

- Real-Time Graph: The game features a graph that starts rising (or 'crashing') from 1x in real time as soon as the round begins.
- Increasing Multiplier: As the graph rises, the associated payout multiplier also increases.
- Bet and Cash Out: Before the start of each round, players place their bets. Once the round begins and the graph is rising, players must decide at which point to serve. If they cash out before the graph "crashes" (or stops), they earn a payout based on the multiplier they cashed out at.

## Strategy

- The script identifies a sequence of 4 results with result <=1.99
- After identifying this pattern, he starts the bet with the auto-cashout set at 2.00x
- In case of loss, it will double the amount bet on the next round up to a maximum of 7 times, thus totaling 8 maximum bets
- If by the eighth bet the result has not yet been >=2.00, the script considers stop loss and returns to looking for the pattern again
This strategy, based on this data, generates guaranteed profit in the long term
